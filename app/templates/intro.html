    Welcome to <em>Regex Adventure!</em> An online game that teaches
    <em>you</em> how to effectively use regular expressions with fun interactive
    stories!</p>
    <p>Regular Expressions (or regexes for short) are a powerful tool for
    matching substrings within a large piece of text.  Think
    <strong>Ctrl-F</strong> on steroids!  But unlike Ctrl-F, you can match
    against more than just specific characters.  What if you wanted to search a
    document for all words longer than four characters?  Text formatted like an
    address?  All variable names in hyphenated-case?  Strings inside
    parenthesis?  Valid email addresses?  It's all possible and more with
    regular expressions, all you have to learn are some special sequences than
    can more than just one character.  If that doesn't make sense, don't worry,
    it will soon!</p>

    <p>The most simple regular expression just contains simple (or <em>literal</em>) charcacters.  It
    works just like Ctrl-F!  The goal of each level is to select all the of the
    red text, and nothing else, so to continue select the string below by typingthe
    regex "Let's go!"</p>
